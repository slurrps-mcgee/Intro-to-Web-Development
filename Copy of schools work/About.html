<h1>Kenneth Lamb</h1>

<hr/>

<p>I am from Glens Falls and my major at Suny ACC is Information Technology with an emphasis in app development. Currently I have a degree in Graphic Arts. I currently work in IT as a helpdesk technician. Some of my hobbies include building custom computers,fixing devices, and working on graphic desigs. My plans when I leave ACC is to attend a 4 year college and become a Software Engineer or maybe a Web Developer I'm not quite sure yet. I greatly enjoy figuring out how things work!</p>

<h3>Interests</h3>

	<li><a href="https://www.newegg.com/">Computer Building</a></li>

	<p>Newegg.com is a site where you can find computer parts as well as networking devices. I use this as a place to build out custom computers for clients.</p>

<h3>Other Sites I enjoy</h3>

<ul>

	<li><a href="https://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/">This is Why I'm Broke</a></li>
	
	<p>This is why I'm broke is a website with a lot of weird gadgets that can go from cheap to extremely expensive it is quite enjoyable to just go through all of the things there from a simple drone to a full on jetpack</p>
	
	<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/?utm_source=adwords-brand&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=NEW-AW-PROS-Branded-Search-World-EN-ENG_._ci__._sl_ENG_._vi__._sd_All_._la_EN_._&tabei=7&utm_term=_._ag_48933380294_._ad_279519253626_._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_kwd-310556426868_._li_9004941_._pd__._&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkqzQ-c3L5AIVk1uGCh2N7AV8EAAYASAAEgJ_wfD_BwE">Udemy</a></li>
	
	<p>Udemy is a website with a lot of learning videos that you can purchase on just about anything. I find it quite extensive when using it to learn more about computer hardware, graphics, or coding.</p>
	
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a></li>
	
	<p>Good old youtube, here you will find most of the videos on the Internet on literally anything. I find it to be a good place to find instructional videos from time to time. Or I just use it as my background noise as I do other things.</p>
