	<h1>10 spooky halloween facts</h1>

	<blockquote>Halloween originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would light bonfires and dress up in costumes to ward off ghosts.

They also believed that the night of the 31st ghosts of the dead returned to earth and the line between the living and the dead became blurred. Here are some facts about the holiday.</blockquote>
