	<!--Here we are displaying the paragraph with the p tag-->
	<p>JavaScript allows us to add text to our web pages in a new way.  These lines of text are being displayed using basic HTML code which we have learned previously.  We certainly have demonstrated our skills in HTML on many occasions already.</p>
	
	<!--This is where we call the java script file to print out the second paragraph-->
	<script type="text/javascript" src="source1.js"></script>
	
	<!--We will use another p tag for this paragraph-->
	<p>We also need to realize that we can switch back and forth, so this text should be created using HTML code again.  This way we realize that we can incorporate the best of both worlds into our web pages.</p>
	
	<!--This is where we call the java script file to print out the fourth paragraph-->
	<script type="text/javascript" src="source2.js"></script>
