Once again the Adirondack Balloon Festival came to the Glens Falls region.  
Launch sites included Crandall Park (in Glens Falls) and the Floyd Bennett Airport (in Queensbury).  An additional "Moonglow" event was held in Queensbury.  Balloonists from all over the U.S. came to the area to help make this year's event a memory to be cherished as part of the tradition that is now known nationwide as the "Adirondack Balloon Festival."

While the festival attracts specialty balloons yearly, the highlight this year was 
the "Darth Vader" balloon.  Saturday's launch witnessed the "Stinky" balloon
and the "Pirate" balloon.

Sponsors of last year's event were thrilled at the overall turnout and crowd reaction
to the festival.  They also announced that the festival will be continuing in the region
for the forseeable future.  Finally, they announced plans to sponsor even more specialty
balloons for 2018's rally which once again will occur during the next-to-last weekend 
of September.  Start making your plans, because organizers have already begun their work
and festival goers have started making reservations at local hotels!
