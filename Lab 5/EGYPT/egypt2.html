<h2>Egypt - January 2018</h2>

<hr />


<p>
In January, the International Studies Program of SUNY Adirondack sponsored a trip to Egypt.  On January 4th, 23 students and faculty departed
from ACC and traveled throughout Egypt.  The group returned from Egypt on January
19th with a host of memories, an immense number of pictures, literally a ton of
souvenirs, and certainly a better understanding of the people and culture of
Egypt.  It was a trip that none of the participants will soon forget and a time
that enriched us all.

After arriving in Cairo, the group traveled to the Red Sea region of Egypt.
While staying in El Ghouna, a major activity was a snorkeling trip on the Red Sea.
A boat first transported everyone to an island beach to enjoy the sun and water,
although temperatures hovered in the mid-60s.  After lunch, the boat took everyone
to a coral reef for an opportunity to snorkel.  For those who went, the colors of
the fish were magnificent and the clarity of the water allowed everyone to see
the vast array of species present.  It was truly a unique opportunity.

The next stop on the itinerary was the Luxor region in which many of the 'key'
archaeological sites are located.  Visits to the Karnak and Luxor Temples 
introduced the group to the grandeur and scale of what was to come throughout the
rest of the trip.  The next day included visiting the Valley of the Kings (with 
a tour of King Tut's tomb), Hatshepsut's Temple, the worker's village, and the 
tomb of Ramose.  At all of these sites one could only be amazed by the immensity 
of the ancient Egyptian culture and civilization that could produce these sites.

A cruise along the Nile River took everyone to Aswan.  Along the way tours of
Edfu and Kom Omba allowed the group to keep their 'land legs.'  Upon arriving in
Aswan, visits to the Aswan Dam, the Nubian Museum, and the Philae Temple 
(including a special night show) showed further artifacts of incredible beauty.
A daybreak bus trip took the group to visit the famed Abu Simbel along the shore
of Lake Nassar (in Southern Egypt).

An overnight train returned the group to Cairo for the remainder of their 
stay in Egypt.  Sites in Cairo included visiting a mosque, the 'Hanging Church,'
the Cairo bazaar (for shopping), and of course the Cairo Museum (to see the
Royal mummies and King Tut's artifacts).  A day trip took us to Alexandria and
included a tour of the new Library of Alexandria.  But perhaps the most memorable
portion of Cairo involves the most famous sites:  the pyramids and the Sphinx.
Regardless of one's preparation, it proves inadequate as one stands in the
shadow of these incredible structures.  To think of the time and effort, while
also considering the age when built, gives one a moment of unforgettable awe.
Before returning to the US, the group performed the 'required' tourist ritual of
riding a camel.  Despite the cliché of the moment, it was a fun time for all.

<p>
While it is impossible to adequately describe either the scope of the trip,
or the immensity of the culture of Egypt, one thing is clear:  none of the 
participants on the trip were able to walk away unchanged by the journey!
