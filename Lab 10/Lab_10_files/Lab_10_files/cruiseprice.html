	   Purpose:  This program asks the user what type of cabin they would like,
                     single or double occupancy, whether they want a porthole or not,
		     and whether they're booking their trip early or not.  Based on
		     these answers, this program then calculates the final cost of
		     the cruise for the customer.   -->

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to the Cruise Price Calculator</h1>
<h3>This page allows you to calculate whether you will have any additional fees or any savings
on your upcoming cruise with us.  We first need to ask you for some information, and then
we'll calculate the cost of your cruise. <br />
<br />
Here's what you need to tell us: <br />
<br />
1) Do you want a double occupancy cabin ($700) or a single occupancy cabin ($1200)?<br />
2) Would you like to have a porthole (window) in your cabin? <em>(There's an additional fee of $150 for this.)</em> <br />
3) Are you booking your trip 60 or more days in advance? <em>(There's a 15% discount if you are!)</em><br />
<br />
</h3>
