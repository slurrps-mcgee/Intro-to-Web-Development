<h1>A Fun Guessing Game</h1>
</div>
<!--  Add code to introduce purpose of this program -->
<p>This program is a basic guessing game. The computer creates a number between 1 and 4 and asks you to guess the secret number.</p>


<script language="JavaScript">

// Declare Variables


var intMysteryNum = CalculateMysteryNumber();  // creates the mystery number the user is to guess


// declare other variables needed
	
				// A user's guess as a text
	var usersGuess;
				// A user's guess as an int 
	var intNumber;


  //  Add JavaScript code to prompt user for their guess,
  //  being sure to remind them the value should be between 1 and 4:
	usersGuess= window.prompt("Please enter in a guess between 1 and 4");

	document.write("<br/>")
	
  //  Convert the string value the user entered into an integer:
  intNumber = parseInt(usersGuess);
	
	  //  Print to the screen the value the user guessed:
	document.write("You guessed the secret number was " + intNumber);
	
	document.write("<br/>")
	document.write("<br/>")
	
  //  Add JavaScript code which determines if the user's guess
  //  was correct, too big, or too small and prints an appropriate
  //  message in each case.  If the guess was not correct, we should
  //  tell the user what the mystery number was.  I'd 'guess' some
  //  sort of branching structure would be best here!?  Perhaps an
  //  if statement or if ... else statement? (hint, hint)
	if(intNumber == intMysteryNum)
		document.write("You guessed correct the mystery number was " + intMysteryNum);
	else if(intNumber < intMysteryNum)
		document.write("Your guess was too small, the correct number was " +  intMysteryNum);
	else if(intNumber > intMysteryNum)
		document.write("Your guess was too large, the correct number was " + intMysteryNum);
	
	  // Leave this alone:
  var strChoice = window.prompt("Play again?","yes");

  if(strChoice=="yes")
	 window.location.reload();
